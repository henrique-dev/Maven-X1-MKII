### Description

Built from a 3D model, its control is carried out through communication
between its applications with that of a smartphone. Both applications will be made in Java.

Its movement will be by movements calculated in real time, not requiring an algorithmic scheme.

Your hardware consists of:
- 1 Raspberry Pi Zero
- 2 PCA9685 PWM Modules
- 1 MPU 9250
- 18 MG995 Servo Motor

At the root of the project there are directories:

**Raspberry** is the code related to the robot application.
